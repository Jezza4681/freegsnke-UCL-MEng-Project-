    "Notice how passive coils have the 'active': False property (distinguishing them from the actual active coils) and have a multiplier value less than 1 (in the polygon case). This is because the polygon has been refined under the hood using lots of individual filaments. If we were to assign a current to this passive structure, the multiplier says that each filament will be assigned this fraction of the total current. This helps spread the total current over the total surface area of the polygonal shape. "
